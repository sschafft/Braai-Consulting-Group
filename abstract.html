								<p>Grow is an interactive web agency with 30 staff based in Norfolk, Virginia. They work with top-tier clients and produce cutting edge work. This engagement focused on using organization development methodologies to help address the presented need of “developing a professional development framework”. Data was collected through interviews, surveys, focus groups, document review, observation and external benchmarking. The engagement was fundamentally influenced by Appreciative Inquiry as well as Gestalt perspectives. These overarching theories were used in conjunction with other specific models such as the Burke-Litwin model, the Drexler-Sibbet Model as well as Schein’s levels of culture. </p>

								<p>Based on analysis of the data as well as discussion with the client, it became apparent that what was core to the issue at hand was based not on a “professional development framework” but instead a more pervasive question of building a culture of professional development. It also pointed to the need to align strategy, culture, management practice and leadership towards professional development rather than simply create a framework. </p>

								<p>This paper showcases this analysis and outlines the methodologies and process that were part of the entire client engagement with Grow. </p>
